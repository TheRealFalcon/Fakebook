Fakebook
========

This project was originally created as a way for me to learn Android, and to act as an electronic "Fakebook" (not to be confused with Facebook).  A fakebook is a book of musical lead sheets that allows a musician to 'fake it' through a song that they don't really know.  Since I have a large collection of sheet music and chord sheets, my plan was to digitize all the music and use my tablet (a nook color) to play it.  After trying it, I realized the NCs screen is way too small to actually read much music, and android's lack of decent pdf support was a setback as well.  Since my tablet is too small to read music on, I've pretty much abandoned this project.  If I ever get a bigger tablet, I might pick it back up again, but by that time 'OnSong' will probably have an android port that would blow away anything I'm making.

Usage
-----

Put any image or txt files in a folder named 'fakebook' at the root of the sd card.
Alternatively, you can put the folder anywhere and specfiy the folder at the first app startup.
Simply select your songs on the left and they'll be added to the playlist on the right.
Select 'Start' (or 'Go' or whatever verb I used) to show the first song.  You can swipe left and right to switch songs.
